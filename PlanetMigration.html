                                <p>We carry out three-dimensional SPH simulations to study whether planets can survive in self-gravitating protoplanetary discs. The discs modelled here use a cooling prescription that mimics a real disc which is only gravitationally unstable in the outer regions. We do this by modelling the cooling using a simplified method such that the cooling time in the outer parts of the disc is shorter than in the inner regions, as expected in real discs. We find that both giant ( &gt; M<sub>Sat</sub> ) and low mass ( &lt; M<sub>Nep</sub> ) planets initially migrate inwards very rapidly, but are able to slow down in the inner gravitationally stable regions of the disc without needing to open up a gap. This is in contrast to previous studies where the cooling was modelled in a more simplified manner where regardless of mass, the planets were unable to slow down their inward migration. This shows the important effect the thermodynamics has on planet migration. In a broader context, these results show that planets that form in the early stages of the discs' evolution, when they are still quite massive and self-gravitating, can survive.</p>

                                entire disc being gravitationally unstable (see Fig 1a). Realistic self-gravitating
                                discs are expected to only be gravitationally unstable in the outer regions. <br><br>

                                Using a variable \(\beta \) allows us to mimic a realistic self-gravitating disc (see
                                Fig 1b). The longer cooling time in the inner disc results in a gravitationally stable
                                region with very little density fluctuations. The aim of this work is to determine
                                whether planets can slow down their inward migration in the smoother inner disc.

                            <p>The coorbital material around the planet plays a key role in its migration. Initially the
                                planet begins its migration in the gravitationally unstable part of the disc, where the
                                density fluctuates a lot. These fluctuations results in an underdense region forming in
                                front of the planet which drives its inward migration in both models. Since the entire
                                disc is gravitationally unstable with a constant \(\beta \), the corotation torque
                                remains negative throughout and the planet is unable to slow down (Figure 3a). However
                                with a variable \(\beta \), the planet is able to slow down once it reaches the
                                gravitationally stable inner disc. This smoother region results in the structure around
                                the planet becoming symmetric, thus decreasing the negative corotation torque and slows
                                the planet down (Figure 3b).

                                    fluctuations throughout results in asymmetric structure around the planet as it
                                    migrates. Hence, the negative corotation torque remains high and the planet is
                                    unable to stop its inward migration. In a variable \(\beta \) disc (b) the smooth
                                    inner disc results in symmetric structure around the planet once it reaches the
