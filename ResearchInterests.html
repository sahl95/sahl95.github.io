                    <p>I am interested in the evolution of a particular class of protoplanetary discs; self-gravitating discs which are young, massive and turbulent. My interests are driven by the following topics:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The impact of the star-forming environment on the evolution of protoplanetary discs.</li>
                        <li>Planet migration in self-gravitating discs.</li>
                        <li>Impact of planet-disc interactions on the structure of protoplanetary discs.</li>
                        <li>The dust dynamics in protoplanetary discs.</li>
                        <li>Warped gravitationally unstable protoplanetary discs</li>
                        <li>Connecting simulations with observed disc features.</li>

                                We perform three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to investigate the formation of spiral arms in misaligned circumbinary discs. In a nearly broken disc the misaligned inner and outer discs interact at two nodes, launching leading spiral arms that do not rotate with the disc. These spirals vanish when the disc is fully broken or aligned. Our results show that the formation of leading spirals is driven by the relative misalignment of the inner and outer disc, and does not depend on the disc physics.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                                With live radiative transfer, the shadows cast by the misaligned inner disc are also able to launch trailing spiral arms that only appear at high misalignments when the discs are disconnected. When the disc is strongly misaligned, leading and trailing spiral arms can both appear and interact with each other. At lower misalignments, the impact of shadows is negligible and leading spiral arms are seen instead.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The presence of both leading and trailing spiral arms implies that the rotation of the disc cannot be assumed based on the orientation of the spiral arms alone. Unlike spirals formed by gravitational instability, the spirals in this work can also form in low-mass, gravitationally stable discs.

                                Irradiation from the central star controls the temperature structure in protoplanetary discs. Yet simulations of gravitational instability typically use models of stellar irradiation with varying complexity, or ignore it altogether, assuming heat generated by spiral shocks is balanced by cooling, leading to a self-regulated state. In this paper, we perform simulations of irradiated, gravitationally unstable protoplanetary discs using 3D hydrodynamics coupled with live Monte-Carlo radiative transfer.
                              </p>
                              <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                                We find that the resulting temperature profile is approximately constant in time, since the thermal effects of the star dominate. Hence, the disc cannot regulate gravitational instabilities by adjusting the temperatures in the disc. In a 0.1 Solar mass disc, the disc instead adjusts by angular momentum transport induced by the spiral arms, leading to steadily decreasing surface density, and hence quenching of the instability. 
                                Thus, strong spiral arms caused by self-gravity would not persist for longer than ten thousand years in the absence of fresh infall, although weak spiral structures remain present over longer timescales. Using synthetic images at 1.3mm, we find that spirals formed in irradiated discs are challenging to detect.

                              <p>
                                In higher mass discs, we find that fragmentation is likely because the dominant stellar irradiation overwhelms the stabilising influence of PdV work and shock heating in the spiral arms.

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"> We carry out three dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to study the role of gravitational and drag forces on the concentration of large dust grains (St > 1) in the spiral arms of gravitationally unstable protoplanetary discs, and the resulting implications for planet formation.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                            We find that both drag and gravity play an important role in the evolution of large dust grains. If we include both, grains that would otherwise be partially decoupled will become well coupled and trace the spirals. For the dust grains most influenced by drag (with Stokes numbers near unity), the dust disc quickly becomes gravitationally unstable and rapidly forms clumps with masses between 0.15 - 6 Earth masses. A large fraction of clumps are below the threshold where runaway gas accretion can occur. However, if dust self-gravity is neglected, the dust is unable to form clumps, despite still becoming trapped in the gas spirals. When large dust grains are unable to feel either gas gravity or drag, the dust is unable to trace the gas spirals. Hence, full physics is needed to properly simulate dust in gravitationally unstable discs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dust trapping of large grains in spiral arms of discs stable to gas fragmentation could explain planet formation in very young discs by a population of planetesimals formed due to the combined roles of drag and gravity in the earliest stages of a disc's evolution. Furthermore, it highlights that gravitationally unstable discs are not just important for forming gas giants quickly, it can also rapidly form Earth mass bodies.</p>

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">We carry out 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to study the impact of planet-disc interactions on a gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disc. We find that the impact of a planet on the disc's evolution can be described by three scenarios. If the planet is sufficiently massive, the spiral wakes generated by the planet dominate the evolution of the disc and gravitational instabilities are completely suppressed. If the planet's mass is too small, then gravitational instabilities are unaffected. If the planet's mass lies between these extremes, gravitational instabilities are weakened.
                            </p><p>
                            We present mock Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) continuum observations showing that the observability of large-scale spiral structures is diminished or completely suppressed when the planet is massive enough to influence the disc's evolution. Our results show that massive discs that would be expected to be gravitationally unstable can appear axisymmetric in the presence of a planet. Thus, the absence of observed large-scale spiral structures alone is not enough to place upper limits on the disc's mass, which could have implications on observations of young Class I discs with rings and gaps. </p>

                            <p>We perform 3D SPH simulations of warped, non-coplanar gravitationally unstable discs to show that as the warp propagates through the self-gravitating disc, it heats up the disc rendering it gravitationally stable. Thus losing their spiral structure and appearing completely axisymmetric. In their youth, protoplanetary discs are expected to be massive and self-gravitating, which results in non-axisymmetric spiral structures. However recent observations of young protoplanetary discs with ALMA have revealed that discs with large-scale spiral structure are rarely observed in the midplane. Instead, axisymmetric discs with some also having ring & gap structures are more commonly observed. Our work involving warps, non-coplanar disc structures that are expected to commonly occur in young discs, potentially resolves this discrepancy between observations and theoretical predictions. We demonstrate that they are able to suppress the large-scale spiral structure of self-gravitating protoplanetary discs.</p>

We present mock ALMA continuum observations which show that in the absence of a planet, spiral arms due to gravitational instability are easily observed. Whereas in the presence of a giant planet, the spiral structures are suppressed by the migrating planet resulting in a largely axisymmetric disc with a ring and gap structure. Our modelling of the gas kinematics shows that the planet's presence could be inferred, for example, using optically thin <sup>13</sup>C<sup>16</sup>O. Our results show that it is not necessary to limit the gas mass of discs by assuming high dust-to-gas mass ratios in order to explain a lack of spiral features that would otherwise be expected in high mass discs.</p>

                            <p>We carry out three-dimensional SPH simulations to study whether planets can survive in self-gravitating protoplanetary discs. The discs modelled here use a cooling prescription that mimics a real disc which is only gravitationally unstable in the outer regions. We do this by modelling the cooling using a simplified method such that the cooling time in the outer parts of the disc is shorter than in the inner regions, as expected in real discs. We find that both giant (&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;M<sub>Sat</sub>&nbsp;) and low mass (&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;M<sub>Nep</sub>&nbsp;) planets initially migrate inwards very rapidly, but are able to slow down in the inner gravitationally stable regions of the disc without needing to open up a gap. This is in contrast to previous studies where the cooling was modelled in a more simplified manner where regardless of mass, the planets were unable to slow down their inward migration. This shows the important effect the thermodynamics has on planet migration. In a broader context, these results show that planets that form in the early stages of the discs' evolution, when they are still quite massive and self-gravitating, can survive.</p>
