                <p>
                  We perform 3D SPH simulations of warped, non-coplanar gravitationally unstable discs to show that as the warp propagates through the self-gravitating disc, it heats up the disc rendering it gravitationally stable. Thus losing their spiral structure and appearing completely axisymmetric. In their youth, protoplanetary discs are expected to be massive and self-gravitating, which results in non-axisymmetric spiral structures. However recent observations of young protoplanetary discs with ALMA have revealed that discs with large-scale spiral structure are rarely observed in the midplane. Instead, axisymmetric discs with some also having ring & gap structures are more commonly observed. Our work involving warps, non-coplanar disc structures that are expected to commonly occur in young discs, potentially resolves this discrepancy between observations and theoretical predictions. We demonstrate that they are able to suppress the large-scale spiral structure of self-gravitating protoplanetary discs.

                <p class="texthover">
                  When discs are young, they are expected to be quite massive.
                  A characteristic feature of massive discs are large scale
                  spiral features due to gravitational instabilities. However,
                  observations of recent protoplanetary discs

                  in the last few years have shown that most discs tend to be

                  Does the lack of observed large scale spiral structures
                  imply that young discs are not as massive as expected? Or
                  can signatures of gravitational instabilities be hidden? It
                  is reasonable to assume that gravitationally unstable discs
                  do not evolve in isolation. There are many complex processes
                  that can occur during the self-gravitating phase of the disc
                  that can warp the disc and alter its evolution. These
                  include a misaligned internal (planetary or stellar)
                  companion, a misaligned unbound stellar companion (flyby),
                  or misaligned infalling material from chaotic accretion
                  episodes.
                  <font color="white" style="font-weight: 500">Our aim is to investigate whether physical processes such
                    as warps can hide signatures of gravitational

            <h3>Evolution of a Warped Disc</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The disc is first evolved without a warp until the disc is
                gravitationally stable and in a steady state. We then include
                an idealised warp to understand the impact of a warp on the
                disc's evolution.
              </li>
              <li>
                As the disc evolves, the warp propagates radially both inwards
                and outwards.
              </li>
              <li>
                Since the warp was introduced numerically, it is not
                sustained. Thus as the disc continues to evolve, the warp
                smooths out and the disc becomes coplanar.
              </li>
              <li>
                The influence of the warp quickly suppresses the spiral
                structures yielding an axisymmetric gravitationally stable
                disc.

            <h3>Why Does the Disc Heat Up?</h3>
            <p>
              The PdV work plays an important role in altering the disc's
              evolution. The divergence of the velocity is directly linked to
              the PdV work, so we use it as a proxy for the PdV work.
            </p>
            <h3>The Impact on the Velocities</h3>
            <ul>
              <li class="texthover">
                In the warped region of the disc, adjacent annuli of gas are
                misaligned with varying vertical height \(z\). This results in
                an
                <a href="images/HidingGI_Warps/InitRwarp_withCaption.png" target="_blank" style="display: inline"><img src="images/HidingGI_Warps/InitRwarp_withCaption.png" alt="" />

                </a>
                as the gas traverses an orbit.
              </li>
              <li>
                This oscillating radial pressure gradient can trigger a strong
                response in the radial velocity of the disc (Lodato & Pringle
                2007), which heats up the disc. This is especially apparent in
                the early stages as seen by the large magnitudes of the
                velocity divergence.
              </li>
              <li>
                As the warp dissipates, there is little variance in the
                pressure gradient. Thus, the magnitude of velocity divergence
                has greatly decreased as expected leading to less heating from
                PdV work.
